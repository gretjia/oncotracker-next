# Changelog

## v0.7.6 (2025-12-06)

- **Feature:** **Excel-like Data Editor** - Completely redesigned the 'Edit Data' page for a dense, professional spreadsheet experience with compact rows and sharper borders.
- **Feature:** **Frozen Headers** - Implemented sticky positioning for the first 5 rows (Header + 4 Data Rows) to keep critical data visible while scrolling.
- **Feature:** **Adjustable Columns** - Added drag-to-resize functionality for all data columns.
- **UX:** **Morandi Header Theme** - Applied the "Morandi Rainbow" color scheme (opaque) to frozen rows, matching the Journey Visualizer's aesthetic and preventing scroll-through artifacts.

## v0.7.5 (2025-12-06)

- **Feature:** **Settings Persistence** - Patient journey settings (metric visibility, colors, scale, shift, phase opacity) are now automatically saved per user and per patient.
- **Feature:** **Metric Color Picker** - Restored the ability to customize metric line and dot colors directly from the controls panel.
- **Fix:** **Database Migration** - Added missing `patient_journey_settings` table and RLS policies to enable settings persistence.
- **Fix:** **Middleware** - Migrated `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` to align with Next.js 16 conventions.

## v0.7.4 (2025-12-04)

- **Critical Fix:** Resolved "Missing Metric" and "Wrong Metric Name" issues in Patient Journey Visualizer.
- **Data Integrity:** Enforced strict canonical format validation. Raw files are no longer accepted; uploads must successfully map to the canonical schema.
- **Robustness:** Improved `data-loader` to intelligently detect header rows using known metric keywords, preventing data-row-as-header errors.
- **UX:** "Create Patient" button is now disabled until AI analysis completes successfully, preventing accidental unmapped uploads.
- **Fix:** Relaxed AI schema validation to handle case variations (e.g., "Custom" vs "CUSTOM") without failing.

## [v0.7.3] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- **AI Streaming Architecture**:
  - **Real-time "Thinking" UI**: Implemented `AIThinkingLog` component to visualize the AI's thought process during file analysis.

- **Manual Data Entry**:
  - **Template Generator**: Added "Start with Empty Template" button to the Add Patient page.
  - **Canonical Template**: Automatically generates an empty Excel file with standard headers (Weight, CEA, MRD, etc.) for manual filling.

### Fixed

- **Runtime Stability**: Fixed `phaseName.includes` crash in `PatientJourneyVisualizer` by safely casting column values to strings.
- **Build System**: Resolved `Module not found: Can't resolve 'ai/react'` by installing `@ai-sdk/react`.

## [v0.7.1] - 2025-12-03

### Added

- **Data Standardization**:
  - **Canonical Schema**: Established `张莉.xlsx` as the canonical data structure for all patient uploads.
  - **Metric Dictionary**: Created `lib/schema/metric-dictionary.ts` with bilingual (Chinese/English) metric definitions.
